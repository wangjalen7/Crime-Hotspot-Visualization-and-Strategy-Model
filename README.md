# Crime-Hotspot-Visualization-and-Strategy-Model

This project was done as part of ML4VA, a university-wide competition aimed to prepare students to apply what they learn in machine learning courses to a real-world scenario, specifically to help the state of Virginia. Through the chosen projects, students will be working in a team of three to use machine learning to make a meaningful contribution to the well-being of the state of Virginia and its residents.
